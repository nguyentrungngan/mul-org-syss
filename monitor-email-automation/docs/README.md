# Monitor Email Automation

## 1️ Situation
In the manufacturing process, multiple data sources (PLC systems, MES, and manually input files) must be monitored to ensure compliance with predefined operational rules. Currently, this monitoring process is manual, leading to potential delays and errors.

## 2️ Solution
- Develop an automated system that continuously checks data from various sources.
- Implement configurable rules to detect anomalies and trigger email alerts.
- Automate email notifications to the relevant management and administration teams.

## 3️ Expected Outcomes
- Automated real-time monitoring reduces manual effort and errors.
- Instant notifications allow rapid response to critical deviations.
- The system is flexible, allowing configuration of rules, email recipients, and data sources as needed.
