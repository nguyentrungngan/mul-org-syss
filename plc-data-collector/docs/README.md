## 1. Situation
The production system needs to collect data from automated machines (PLC) and store it on a server for monitoring and reporting. However, the existing system does not support automatic data retrieval.

---

## 2. Approach
- Develop a simple program to fetch data from PLC machines.
- Build a middleware application to receive and store data in a database.
- Prepare data in a structured way for easy integration with other systems.

---

## 3. Expected Outcome
- PLC data is collected automatically and stored securely.
- The system is designed to be easily expandable for future integration.
